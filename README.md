# HR-CONNECT App
The HR-Connect Application is a SaaS project designed to be an invaluable tool for both small and established businesses, helping to eliminate paperwork while making data access and storage more flexible. Employers can use the app to manage employee data and easily share it with third parties like CRA, WagePoint, and DayForce. The project is still in developmentâ€”I'm about 80% done with the user interface, which is both user-friendly and easy to navigate. However, the backend work, API integration, and data binding will be ongoing tasks, even beyond my initial goals, to ensure continuous user satisfaction.
